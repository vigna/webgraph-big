[WebGraph](http://webgraph.di.unimi.it/) is a framework for graph
compression aimed at studying web graphs. It provides simple ways to
manage very large graphs, exploiting modern compression techniques.

This big version of WebGraph can manage graphs as large as your core
memory allows. For graphs with less than 2³¹ nodes, and for general
information pertaining the big version, too, have a look at the [standard
version](https://github.com/vigna/webgraph).
